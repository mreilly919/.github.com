<a href="http://www.holidayinn.com/hotels/us/en/crystal-lake/chicl/hoteldetail?qAdlt=1&qBrs=6c.hi.ex.rs.ic.cp.in.sb.cw.cv.ul.vn&qChld=0&qFRA=1&qGRM=0&qPSt=0&qRRSrt=rt&qRef=df&qRms=1&qRpn=1&qRpp=20&qSHp=1&qSmP=3&qSrt=sBR&qWch=0&srb_u=1&icdv=99618083&cm_mmc=mdpr-_-TripAdvisorUS-_-BLwebsite-_-HI_CHICL&glat=MEDI&icdv=99618083">The Holiday Inn Crystal Lake</a>
will once again be welcoming us. Jennifer has reserved a block of
rooms for us. Rooms are single king or two double beds. Adjoining rooms are available. We were unable to reserve any suites, as they now only hold those for weddings. If you would like to reserve a suite, you will have to do so outside of the room block at the full rate.
The hotel's phone number is (815) 477-7000. Please be sure to mention you are with the Reilly Reunion for the discounted rate.</p>
<b>Online Booking Instructions:</b> You must enter an arrival and departure date within our group block dates of Friday July 14th through Monday July 17th. The group’s code is already on the link so once the dates are entered the link will pull up the rooms that are available at the special contracted rate in the block. If your enter an arrival or departure date that is outside of the blocked dates then the link will not work. Important: If you are planning to arrive or depart outside of these dates, it is best to call to make your reservation to receive the guaranteed block rate.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Events:</span><br>
Our event committee has been hard at work and has confirmed a few activities that will take place at the Reunion. We will play Family Feud, have a Karaoke night, and also have a videographer there to capture all of the fun! There will also be some of the same actives present as last year such as the water slide, volleyball court, boat rides and seadoos. The committee is still hard at work on additional ideas, so please feel free to share any ideas you have with them!<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">REMINDER, We Need Photos:</span><br>
A slideshow of family photos is being put together for display at the reunion. We’d love to get your photos. If you have pictures you’d like have shown you can upload them to an Amazon Photo account that has been created, or email them to michaeljreilly@gmail.com<br><br>
If you are interested in uploading individual photos or an entire folder of them to the reunion's Amazon Photo account go to: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/family">https://www.amazon.com/photos/family</a><br><br>
If you have an Amazon account and are already logged in, you’ll need to log out and log back in using the following:<br><br>
Username: 2017reillyreunion@gmail.com<br>
Password: reilly<br><br>
Once you’re logged in, along the top of the screen to the right of the search box is an Add button. Click that and you’ll be able to select from uploading photos or upload a folder. There is no limit to the number of photos you can upload, so have at it. Don’t worry if you don’t see other's photos, we will be pulling them down as they are added to the slideshow and we wouldn't want to spoil the fun and surprises.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">REMINDER, Race Shop Tour Interest:</span><br>
Aunt Barb and Uncle Arne have offered to take those that are interested to the race shop on Monday the 18th for those that are still in town. We would like to see if this is something that anyone is interested in doing, and if so, how many people from our family would be attending in order to properly accommodate everyone.<br><br>
<p>Our next Reunion Committee Call is Wednesday January 18th 5:30pm Pacific / 8:30pm Eastern. We will continue to provide updates as we get closer to the Reunion!</p>
