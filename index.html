will once again be welcoming us. Jennifer has reserved a block of
rooms for us. Rooms are single king or two double beds. Adjoining rooms are available. We were unable to reserve any suites, as they now only hold those for weddings. If you would like to reserve a suite, you will have to do so outside of the room block at the full rate.
The hotel's phone number is (815) 477-7000. Please be sure to mention you are with the Reilly Reunion for the discounted rate.</p>
<b>Online Booking Instructions:</b> You must enter an arrival and departure date within our group block dates of Friday July 14th through Monday July 17th. The groupâ€™s code is already on the link so once the dates are entered the link will pull up the rooms that are available at the special contracted rate in the block. If your enter an arrival or departure date that is outside of the blocked dates then the link will not work. Important: If you are planning to arrive or depart outside of these dates, it is best to call to make your reservation to receive the guaranteed block rate.
